# CRYPTXchange – static crypto exchange website
Open `index.html` in a browser. No backend; all data is mock (`assets/js/data.js`).
Bootstrap 5.3, Bootstrap Icons (icon font) and the Plus Jakarta Sans font load from CDNs, so an internet connection is needed on first load.

## What changed in v2
- **Validation removed everywhere**: every form has `novalidate`, no required/pattern/min/max attributes, and all JS checks are gone (login, signup, OTP, KYC, withdraw, swap, staking, trade forms, etc.). Any input (or none) is accepted.
- **New design system** (`assets/css/style.css`): dark-first with a lime accent, large radii, pill controls, textured promo cards, light theme still available from the theme toggle.
- **Grouped sidebar** with dropdown sections (Trade, Assets, Rewards & History, Account), a vertical guide line, active marker, and remembered open/closed state.
- **Dashboard rebuilt** as a bento layout: KPI row, monthly performance bars, asset allocation, quick trade, connected wallets, staking card, market, orders, activity.
- **Images**: coins use PNG logos (`CX.chip`), wallets use PNG icons (`assets/img/wallets`). Coin logos load from the cryptocurrency-icons CDN package first and fall back to the local PNG in `assets/img/coins`. Bootstrap's built-in SVG glyphs (select arrow, checkbox tick, switch knob, accordion arrow, close button) are overridden with PNGs in `assets/img/ui`.
- To use official brand artwork, overwrite files in `assets/img/coins/<SYMBOL>.png` and `assets/img/wallets/<name>.png` (same filenames).

## What changed in v3
- **Sidebar accordion**: opening a group now closes the others (click an open group to collapse it).
- **Dashboard**: Asset allocation replaced by an auto-scrolling banner carousel (Staking, Referral, New Listing, Mobile App). Edit the slides in `dashboard.html` (`#dBanners`).
- **Coin dropdowns**: every coin selector (dashboard quick trade, deposit, withdraw, swap from/to, OTC, history asset filter, whitelist, landing quick buy) shows coin logos, names, prices and a search box. Implemented once in `CX.coinSelect` (`app.js`); the native `<select>` stays as the source of truth. To add one, put its id in the `CX.coinSelects([...])` list in `app.js`.
- **Landing page** redesigned as a modern SaaS page: product-preview hero with quick buy, live ticker, stats, markets, feature bento, steps, security, mobile app section, wallets, FAQ and CTA.
- **Mobile app section** (`#app`): App Store / Google Play buttons plus QR codes (`assets/img/qr-ios.png`, `qr-android.png`). The links are placeholders (`apps.apple.com/app/cryptxchange`, `play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cryptxchange.app`). Replace them in `index.html` and regenerate the QR PNGs for your real listings.

## What changed in v4
- Network dropdowns (Mainnet / ERC20 / TRC20 / BEP20) on Deposit, Withdraw and Security now show chain logos, network names and confirm times. Every dropdown has a visible arrow (pure CSS).
- Landing page rebuilt on a centred, symmetric grid: equal-width cards, centred section headings, "View all markets" centred under the table. The wallets section is removed.
- Dashboard banners: floating coins removed, real photo backgrounds.
- Photos are hot-linked from Unsplash (free licence, internet needed) and set as CSS variables `--ph-*` at the top of the v4 block in `style.css`. Credits: Behnam Norouzi, Jakub Żerdzicki, rc.xyz NFT gallery, Luise and Nic, Martin Katler. To use your own photos, change those URLs.

## What changed in v5
- Public header is now: Market · Trade (dropdown: Spot, Futures, OTC, each with icon, title and helper line) · Staking. "Mobile App" is removed from the header (the app section and store buttons remain on the landing page and footer).
- Before login, Market, Spot, Futures, OTC, Staking and New Listing open in the public layout (header only, no sidebar). After login they switch to the sidebar layout.
- Signed-in pages (Dashboard, Wallet, Deposit, Withdraw, Swap, History, Profile, Security, KYC, Settings, Support, Rewards) redirect to the login page when not logged in.
